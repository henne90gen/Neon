# Neon

Neon is an experimental programming language.

## TODO / Ideas

- importing files
    - generate function in every module that contains all 'script' code
    - generate function call to that function in place of the import statement
- allow functions to be placed anywhere
    - in global scope
    - in function scope
    - deeply nested in multiple functions, etc.
    - make sure scoping of variables is done right.
    - basically every function is a lambda
